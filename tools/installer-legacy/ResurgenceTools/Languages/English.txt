# This is the English translation text for the Bloodlines Resurgence Installer.
#
# How to use this file (or create your own):
#  - Any line starting with # is a comment
#  - Only replace the text after the = sign, nothing before it.
#  - Do not replace any lines starting with [, or any lines that looks like [frmWizard]
#  - Do not replace text (usually a number) inside a pair of { } - eg, {0}
#    - These represent text that is filled in during execution.
#    - You can however, re-order them. Instead of:
#        Copying = Copying file {0}...
#           You could use
#        Copying = {0} being copied...
#  - Replace only the text after the = sign
#
# Happy Vampirism!
# - Daedalus
